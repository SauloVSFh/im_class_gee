# scripts_gee

This is a repository with scripts either developed or modified (credits to Profs Sajid Pareeth and Paolo Paron) by me during IHE and TUD courses on Remote Sensing using Google Earth Engine (GEE). There are functionalities here for image classification using "smile cart", "random forest" and "support vector machine". There are also other simpler tasks in "generic", such as band ratio, computing NDVI and EVI, plotting and so on.
